    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, updating, and management of that data. Databases are used to store, manage, and manipulate data in various applications and systems, from simple address books to complex enterprise-level systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two broad categories of database management systems, each with its own characteristics and use cases. Here's a differentiation between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases use a relational data model. Data is organized into tables with rows and columns, and relationships between tables are defined by keys (primary keys and foreign keys).\n",
    "NoSQL databases use various data models, including document-oriented, key-value, column-family, and graph-based models. These models are more flexible and can handle unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases have a fixed schema, which means that the structure of the data (table schema) must be defined before data can be inserted. Any changes to the schema may require altering existing data.\n",
    "NoSQL databases typically have a dynamic or schema-less approach. They allow you to insert data without a predefined schema, which can be advantageous when dealing with evolving or unpredictable data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query Language:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases use the SQL language for querying and manipulating data. SQL provides powerful and standardized querying capabilities, making it well-suited for complex queries.\n",
    "NoSQL databases have their own query languages or APIs tailored to their specific data models. These query languages may not be as standardized or feature-rich as SQL but are designed for efficient access to data in their respective models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are traditionally scaled vertically by adding more resources (CPU, RAM) to a single server. They can be challenging to scale horizontally (across multiple servers) for handling high traffic loads.\n",
    "NoSQL databases are often designed for horizontal scalability. They can distribute data across multiple servers or nodes, making it easier to handle large amounts of data and high throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are well-suited for applications where data structure is stable and the need for complex querying is high, such as traditional relational database applications, financial systems, and reporting.\n",
    "NoSQL databases are preferred for applications with rapidly changing data, high scalability requirements, and where flexibility in data modeling is crucial, such as social media platforms, real-time analytics, and IoT (Internet of Things) applications."

    "HAVING: The HAVING clause filters groups of rows created by the GROUP BY clause. It's used to filter groups based on aggregate functions' results.\n",
